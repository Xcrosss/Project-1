          <h1>Eclipse</h1>
        <p>The shining light hides behind my eyes,<br>
           Comes in a super nova suprise<br>
           My spirit glides into the skies,<br>
           Spreading the perfect heat like the sunrise
        </p>
        <p>I was like a diamond under the beauty<br>
           My current rides out with smooth motions,<br>
           Leaving a taste with intense emotion<br>
           Captured by my tides, sunk to my love potion
        </p>
        <p>The sun sends my wave like a mirage of snow<br>
           I got the moon to favor upon my glow<br>
           With every star touching my inner soul<br>
           A glimpse of darkness in my light entwining with a massive flow
        </p>
        <p>Blinded by my own Eclipse!<br>
           My sun & moon collide<br>
           Until the day we both touch lips
        </p>
    </body>
